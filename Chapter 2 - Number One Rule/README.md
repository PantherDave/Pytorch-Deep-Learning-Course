<h1>The numer one rule of ML</h1>
<br></br>
"If you can build a simple rule-based system that does'nt require machine learning, do that"

<h2>What deep learning is good for</H2>
<ul>
<li>Problems with long lists of rules- when the traditional approach fails, ML/DL may help.</li>
<li>Continually changing environments- DL can adapt ('learn') to new scenarios.</li>
<li>Discovering insights within large collections of data- can you imagin trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<h2>What deep learning is not good for</H2>
<ul>
<li>When you need explainability- the patterns learned by a DL model are typically uninterpretable by a human.</li>
<li>When the the traditional approach is a better option- if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.</li>
<li>When errors are unacceptable- since the output of DL model aren't always predictablel.</li>
<li>When you don't have much data- DL models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results</li>
</ul>
